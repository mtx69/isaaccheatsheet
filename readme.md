Isaac's Cheat Sheet
-------------------

All the items, trinkets, tarots, pics and descriptions from The Binding of Isaac and The Wrath of the Lamb expansion pack on one convenient page. Play the game and have this behind the game window for easy referencing.

### Behind the scenes

This project is a culmination of ideas: 

- using Google Spreadsheets sheets to hold data that could be brought in via PHP
- rename images by using html5 drag and drop and an ajax function
- learning how to use git, github and github pages
- using Google Analytics to see how semantic html really affects SEO
