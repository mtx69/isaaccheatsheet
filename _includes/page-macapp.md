## Isaac's Cheatsheet for Mac OS X

This is simply a specialized browser, made with [Fluid](//fluidapp.com){:target='_blank'}, that loads this website without browser controls. Just open it up, hide the statusbar (command /) and make the window 1920x1080 pixels in width and height. 

If you know of a way to implement this for Windows, <a class="lightbox-31286340382249" style="cursor:pointer;">shoot me an email</a> and I'll see what I can do (or not do :/).
