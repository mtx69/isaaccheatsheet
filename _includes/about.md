## What is this? A cheat sheet for ants?

All the items, trinkets, tarots, pics and descriptions for The Binding of Isaac and The Wrath of the Lamb expansion pack on one convenient page. 

For best results:

- A screen resolution of 1920x1080 or higher
- Chrome seems to work best
- Maximize your browser window for at least 1920x1080

Start your Isaac game and have this site behind the game's window. Now you can play the game and see item definitions while you play without having to alt/command-tab to a browser and perform a search.
 
### Boring Stuff

- site launched May 8th, 2013
- built using Google Spreadsheets to hold item names and descriptions
