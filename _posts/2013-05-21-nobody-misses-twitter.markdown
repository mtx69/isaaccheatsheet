The scrolling on that thing was irritating - sorry. Plus I didn't really like the tweets it was getting back from searching for BOI stuff. If you want it back or have some other ideas <a class="lightbox-31286340382249" style="cursor:pointer;">shoot me an email</a>. I think the reddit widget I made is pretty spiffy though.
