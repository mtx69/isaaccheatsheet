If you're looking for movies have the same sensibilties as the Binding of Isaac, you should check out anything from comedy-horror troupe, Astron-6. Even Edmund likes them.

They're definately influenced by old low-budget-'80s-VHS-scifi-horror-rental movies. They made an underground hit two years ago called Father's Day. It's been called Troma's best production. It's about a man who's on the hunt for a serial rapist that preys on dads... um, it's also a comedy. Not for the squeemish that's for sure. Last year they released Manborg, their love letter to the Eliminators, Robocop and Mortal Kombat. If you're old enough, definately track down their DVDs.
