I made some changes to the item descriptions to improve the search box. 
You can search with special hidden keywords that aren't in the descriptions. 
Things like 'red', 'baby', 'familiar', etc. I tried putting in keywords that people would use to describe what the items **look** like. eg. searching for 'cat' will show Guppy and Tammy items. <!--more--> Also, red hearts are now red heart icons and the soul hearts are white heart icons. 

I might have screwed something up to don't hesitate to <a class="lightbox-31286340382249" style="cursor:pointer;">contact me</a> and tell me what's wrong.
