**The search has moved to the top-left** so if you're playing with the game window over your browser (as you all should :P) you can still type in the search box. I'm not sure how this works on Windows but on OS X it's awesome. I'm also starting to look at the Mechanics Guide more closely so item descriptions should be more accurate.
