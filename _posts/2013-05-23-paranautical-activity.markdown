[Paranautical Activity](http://www.desura.com/games/paranautical-activity){:target='_blank'} looks like a really interesting game. [Northernlion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMAA0GeTsoA&feature=youtu.be&a){:target='_blank'} decribes it as a roguelike FPS like the Binding of Isaac (but in 3D). Can't go wrong for $6 bucks.
