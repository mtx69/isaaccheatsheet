The layout no longer requires 1920 pixel wide displays! I saw that a good amount of people with 1600x900, 1366x768 displays are coming to the site so I made it so that everyone can see the page in some form. <!--more--> It sort of defeats the [purpose](/about) of the site though.

I also added a link to a JoyToKey guide in the [tools](/tools) section.
